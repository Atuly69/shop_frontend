# E-commerce Website using React and Redux

Welcome to the E-commerce Website project! This application is designed to showcase various features of React and Redux for building a modern and responsive e-commerce platform. I have applied inline and external CSS from scratch and did not use any CSS library because none was specified. Bootstrap was used for violet theme inspiration. I have used nodemailer to send password to email in backend.
