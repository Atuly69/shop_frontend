# E-commerce Website using React and Redux

Welcome to the E-commerce Website project! This application is designed to showcase various features of React and Redux for building a modern and responsive e-commerce platform. I have applied CSS from scratch and did not use any CSS library because none was specified. Bootstrap was used for theme inspiration.

## How to Start the Project

### Front End

1. Open the command line and navigate to the folder path of the front-end project.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Replace `http://192.168.29.93:9000` in `apis.js` with 'your IP address' + `:9000`.
4. Run `npm start` in the command line.

### Backend

1. Install MongoDB on your computer.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the folder path of the backend project.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Replace `http://192.168.29.93:3000` for CORS origin in `index.js` with 'your IP address' + `:9000`.
5. Run `node index.js` in the command line.
